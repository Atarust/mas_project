Exercise1

Exercise2


    Apply the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) concept to solve a single-vehicle routing problem in a dynamic environment. 

    You create a graph environment, similar to what we have done in the first exercise session, with one AGV. The task of the AGV is to move from an original node to a destination node. While the AGV is operating, you dynamically remove and add connections to the graph.
    You are expected to spend the first 30 minutes on thinking about a BDI-solution for the problem and discuss it with the teaching assistant, and then spend the next one hour on implementing your BDI-solution in RinSim.

    Create a Gradient Field or Contract Net protocol implementation for a pickup and delivery problem. For this exercise, only the task allocation problem is relevant, e.g. what vehicle is delivering what package.

    use the PlaneRoadModel as the road (as used in SimpleExample) so that vehicle routing becomes simple
    use the DefaultPDPModel for the pickup and delivery problem (as used in TaxiExample)
    use the CommModel for communication (as used in CommExample)
